# WHAT IS PNEUMONIA?

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli.Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications or conditions such as autoimmune diseases.Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia



# Project Overview
In this project, you will apply the skills that you have acquired in this 2D medical imaging course to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.

You will be provided with the medical images with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports.

The project will include access to a GPU for fast training of deep learning architecture, as well as access to 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.



# DESCRIPTION OF THE PNEUMONIA DATASET

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). link textThe dataset contains two kinds of chest X-ray Images: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA, which are stored in two folders. In the PNEUMONIA folder, two types of specifc PNEUMONIA can be recognized by the fle name: BACTERIA and VIRUS.
